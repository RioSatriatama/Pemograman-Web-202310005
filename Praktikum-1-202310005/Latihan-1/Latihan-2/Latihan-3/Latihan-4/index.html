    <p><strong>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages to </strong><br /><strong>Learn in 2022</strong><br />There&rsquo;s no question that software programming is a hot career right now. The
        <span style="color: #ff0000;">U.S. Bureau of </span><br /><span style="color: #ff0000;">Labor Statistics</span>
        projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028, which is more than four times the average for all
        occupations. What&rsquo;s more, the median annual pay for a <br />software programmer is about $106,000, which nearly three times the median pay for all U.S.
        <br />workers.<br />Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, and types of <br />software require knowing and understanding different programming languages&mdash;and it&rsquo;s often
        <br />beneficial to know multiple languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming <br />can be a daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior programming
        <br />experience.<br /><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Master of Science in Computer Science Align program</span></span>
        at Northeastern University is <br />specifically designed for students who want to transition into computer science from another
        <br />field of study.<br />&ldquo;Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds and have them come
        <br />out as software engineers,&rdquo; says Ian Gorton, PhD and director of the graduate computer <br />science programs at Northeastern University&mdash;Seattle. &ldquo;We focus on math, programming, and
        <br />a variety of computer science and engineering concepts.&rdquo;<br />Whether you&rsquo;re new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it helps to know
        <br />which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most popular programming languages <br />of 2020 based on the number of job postings listed on job search site Indeed, the average
        <br />annual salary for those jobs, and factors such as ease of use and potential for growth.<br /><br /><strong>Top 10 Most Popular Programming Languages</strong><br />1. Python<br /><span style="color: #ff0000;">Average annual salary</span>:

        $81.000<br /><br /><strong>7 Other Programming Languages to Consider</strong><br />&bull; Web-based startups are more likely to be programming in Python and JavaScript.<br />&bull; Larger companies tend to develop their internal software applications using C# or Java
        <br />and their Web applications using PHP.<br />&bull; Programs for data analytics typically use the R and MATLAB programming
        <br />languages.<br />&bull; Embedded devices, such as those in the automotive and healthcare industries, run
        <br />software written in C, C++, or Rust.<br />&bull; Applications that run on the cloud are increasingly written in Go or Scala.
        <br />&bull; Mobile applications are increasingly written in Swift or Kotlin.
